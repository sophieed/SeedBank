What's new in SeedBank 2.2?  
=========================

(1) It is now possible to store information about seed packets that 
	have been sown. The user is able to record the date, number, and 
	location of any seeds stored, as well as leaving accompanying 
	notes.

(2) 'Currently Growing' records can be progressed to indicate whether 
	the seeds have successfully germinated, and subsequently become 
	established. The date and number of seeds can be manually 
	specified, or defaulted based on the current date and number of 
	seeds initially sown, respectively. Shortcuts support 'Quick 
	Progress' with default values used.

(3) The 'Currently Growing' records for seeds that have been sown 
	indoors can be updated to reflect 'planting out', and the location 
	of the record will be updated accordingly.

(4)	Bug fixes.
